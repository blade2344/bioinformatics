# Bioinformatics Project

This repository contains scripts and data analysis workflows related to my bioinformatics research.  
The project focuses on analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to explore molecular differences between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant colorectal cancer samples.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Perform quality control, normalization, and clustering of single-cell data.  
- Identify differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions.  
- Conduct pathway and functional enrichment analyses.  
- Explore the tumor microenvironment composition at single-cell resolution.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- **Python** (Scanpy,decoupler,pydeseq2, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Salmon / Alevin** for quantification
- **Linux** (Arch-based system)
- **Git** for version control
